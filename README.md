# utopian-io-reddit
Django project for analyzing the utopian-io entries "reddit.com/r/utopianio" on reddit.
For a long time, every time I logged into utopian, on the right side, I saw the reddit script and the link. I thought that I should analyze the shares made on this link.

The filters I think for the moment.
- entries count
- entry title
- entry author
- entry author_detail full url
- entry link
- entry updated date

Futures
- How are posts shared?
- To be able to pass the created shares over specific filters and create analysis visuals and graphs. (Maybe author's nationality, tags, content types.

Able to be extended with your ideas or suggestions.
